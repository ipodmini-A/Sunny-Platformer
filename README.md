# platformerGame
This program is a basic platformer that has basic RPG elements.
The program at the moment is extremely bare bones. Currently within the program, the player controls a character that has to reach a end goal. Encountering an enemy takes the player to a battle screen.
The game doesn't have a name yet, but as time goes on, if I see I am making progress with this game, I will eventually give it a name.
