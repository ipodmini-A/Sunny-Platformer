# platformerGame
This program is a basic platformer that has basic RPG elements. The name is platformerGame just to show how basic it is.
Currently using this to mess around with game development and practice coding, which is the reason why I am not using a game engine.
The program at the moment is extremely bare bones. Currently within the program, the player controls a character that has to reach a end goal. Encountering an enemy takes the player to a battle screen.
The game doesn't have a name yet, but as time goes on, if I see I am making progress with this game, I will eventually give it a name.
