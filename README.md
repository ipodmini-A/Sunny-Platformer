# Sunny-Platformer 
This program is a basic platformer that has basic RPG elements (Or at least I am planning to add that later).
This serves more as a tech demo then anything, as this whole game is dedicated to me playing around with Java and the
LibGDX library.
Currently, there is no release for the game, but occasionally a build is released and dropped within the "builds" folder.
You just need Java installed to play the game. If you wish to build the game yourself, you just need to create a gradle project.
